## Project Overview
This project presents a rigorous statistical analysis of 150 students across three English course levels (Advanced, Intermediate, Foundation) to validate the effectiveness of The Key's course placement system. The study examines the relationship between aptitude test scores and actual performance to ensure students are placed in appropriate learning environments.

## Research Questions
1. Do students with different performance levels enroll in different course levels?
2. Are there significant differences in aptitude scores across course levels?
3. What is the correlation between aptitude scores and performance?
4. What are the implications for course placement and program quality?
